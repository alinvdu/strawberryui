Common prompts

Project details
We are using storybook, styled-components and create react app.

Theming
The widgets are modern with black blue background, it uses the following colors:
#102131 - gradient color for background, #030714 -gradient color for background, #24111D -
stroke color. Border-radius of 30px.


Folder structure
Create a folder structure for an application called strawberry-ui which is
a framework for open-source react components. There are two main parts of the app, the
components themselves which contain: music widget, pagination, slider, switch, tabs,
calendar, time widget, date picker and the presentation site which has: logo and a text,
two pages, one for theming view and the other for seeing prompts examples. It also contains a
small header with a switch and a button.


Music Widget
Code (ChatGPT):
Create a React component for a music widget, the component accepts an object interface (or
prop-type) and the object has the following fields: title, author, album. It also receives
four functions that will be called inside the component on the following three buttons:
Pause, Play, Next Song, Previous Song.

The dimensions of the widget are the following: 350px wide, 400px height. It's composed of
two parts: the top part has the author name on top and the title of the song and album on
the bottom and it has 328px height. The top part also has a background-image of a strawberry. 

The bottom part contains the buttons aligned in the center, on the left we have previous
song icon, on the middle we have pause/play song and on the right we have next song icon.

Let's add an internal state to the component with the initial value of playing = true. Then
if playing is true we show the pause button, if playing is false we show the play button. If
the user clicks play we change the state and the same with pause. At the same time, the
component receive another prop function called onStateChange that will be called with true
if the state changes to true and false otherwise.

Let's remove the onStateChange prop and just stick with onPlay and onPause

Calendar
Code (ChatGPT):
Create a widget component for a Calendar. It can receive a selected date, a function that
will be called when the date will change. It should have a header part and main content part.
The header part should have two elements that are spaced around the margins. The left
element should hold the date and the year and the right element should contain two arrows
(left & right) that we can use in order to change the month. It should have a background
that's a combination between a gradient and a strawberry image.

Main content should hold the days of the week (S, M, T, W, T, F, S) each on a separate
column and the days of the month should be divided upon those specific columns. In total
should be 7 columns.

Pagination
Code (ChatGPT):
Create a React component for pagination. It should receive the total number of elements and
how many elements are for each page as prop. It should also receive a callback function for
when the page is being changed, which will be called with the page index. It should keep an
internal state of it's current page.

The component has three parts, the left container which contains the left arrow icon, the
middle container which holds the pages number and the right container which contains the
right icon.

The middle container can hold up to 5 numbers, if the total number of pages are more than
5 than we can show the first page, the last page and 3 pages that are near the current page.
Everything in between will be marked by dots.

ToDoList
Code (ChatGPT):
Create a React component named ToDoList. As props it can receive a few pre-defined items,
that can have the following fields: description as a string, done as a boolean. The component
itself is 350px wide and 535px long. It is composed of the following elements:

Wrapper component with a linear gradient.
Container component with a linear gradient and a background picture mixed.
At top it will have a decorating strawberry component image, positioned absolute relative to
the container.

In the middle it will render the list of todos with a background and a small padding. It will
also have a checkbox in front denoting if the todo is checked or not. A TextField beneath
the rendered todos where the user can input the next item.

Two buttons placed:
1. At the bottom in the center, add button, it has a wrapper with a border and then the
button itself.
2. Near the first button but on right top of it. It's just a button with and X.

The component should be able to add new items using the TextField and the Add Button, the
new item should appear in the list. The rendered list should have a height of 190px and the
rest should be scrollable.

Login Page
Code (ChatGPT):
Create a React component for Login the user. It should receive a login url and a function
that will be called upon login completion.

The wrapper should be 450px wide by 374px height, with a border-radius of 45px. It should
also have a container with a border-radius of 45px that also uses a background image with
a strawberry.

The main part contains a form with 3 rows:
- The first row contains an user icon and the username textfield.
- The second row contains the password icon and the password textfield.
- The third row contains the login button.

Time Widget Component
Code (ChatGPT):
Lets implement a Time Widget component in React that will give the user the ability to
select Hours, Minutes and Seconds.

On top part of the widget we three columns, each of them denoting title for the list that
are beneath them in which you can actually scroll and select the values.

The first column is Hours, second is Minutes and third is Seconds.

Beneath this three title columns there is a wide space with a decorating image of
strawberries, that has full width.

Beneath the strawberry image, we find the selected content container, it has three columns
showing the user the currently selected values for each column (hours, minutes, seconds).
If there is no selected value, then we show a blue line. The selected content container,
has a background gradient and is delimited by shadow and border.

Next we have three columns which contain lists for the user to pick the values that populate
each column (hours, minutes, seconds). The lists are scrollable, and the center elements
are the one being picked. The center elements are highlighted by two bars denoting the
currently selected element. The user can also click on any value in order for the selection
to jump at that specific value. For instance if the minute 13 is centered in the list, then
it will be selected, if the minute 16 is not centered but the user clicks on it, the
component will move it to the center and select it.

Requirement: the scroll should be able to move just by 1 value when scrolling softly but
move faster when scrolling rapidly.

3 elements:
